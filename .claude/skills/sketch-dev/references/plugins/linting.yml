    Design linting tool that finds and fixes style inconsistencies in Sketch files like
    spell-check does for text. Build a style library, then scan pages to identify colors,
    text styles, shadows, borders, and radiuses that don't match. Auto-fix inconsistencies
    or ignore one-off styles. Helps maintain design system compliance. Last updated October 2022.
